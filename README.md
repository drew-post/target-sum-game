# Target Sum Game
### Simple Math Game from React Native Essential Training Course on LinkedIn 
#### LinkedIn Course I followed to complete this project: [React Native Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-native-essential-training/) by [Samer Buna](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/samer-buna?u=85172378)

### How to Play
- Upon start, there's a target number and 6 smaller numbers below it.
- The goal of the game is to pick an arrangment of smaller numbers that will equal the target number exactly within the time limit (10 seconds).
- If you win, the target number will turn green, if you lose or time runs out, the target number will turn red.
- After each game, you have the option to play again.
### Notes
- Currently only works on ios
  - Pull down git repo
  - Start Metro Builder (`npx react-native start`)
  - Run app on simulator (`npx react-native run ios`) or device (https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)
- Features I'd like to add to this game in the future
  - Potentially making the game harder as the user wins more games
  - Potentially assigning a score to the user
  - Optimizing the design
